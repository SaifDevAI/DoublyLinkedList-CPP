# Doubly Linked List in C++

This project is a complete implementation of a **Doubly Linked List (DLL)** using modern C++.  
It includes all core operations such as insertion, deletion, traversal, counting occurrences, 
and removing specific elements — all with proper pointer handling.

## 🚀 Features
- Insert at **front** and **end**
- Delete from **front** and **end**
- Delete **specific elements** (all occurrences)
- Count how many times a value appears
- Get the **first** and **last** elements
- Check if the list is empty
- Display the entire list
- Safe memory management using `new` and `delete`

## 🧠 What You’ll Learn
- How doubly linked lists work internally  
- Manual memory management in C++  
- Pointer manipulation (previous & next links)  
- Clean OOP design using classes  
- Error handling for underflow conditions  

## 📚 Code Quality
- Well-structured and beginner-friendly  
- Class-based design (`Node` + `DoublyList`)  
- Test cases included in `main()`  
- Easy to extend into larger DSA or OOP projects  

## 🎯 Perfect For
- DSA practice  
- University assignments  
- C++ learning  
- Coding interviews  
- Anyone exploring low-level data structures  

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- C++ (OOP)
- Pointers
- Dynamic memory
- Linked list data structure design
